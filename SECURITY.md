## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a vulnerability, please email me at cassandra.delacruzmunoz@gmail.com, using my PGP public key.
Don't open an issue, I will take care of that once I see the email.

As to when a fix will be released, well, it'll be released sooner if others decide to help.
I can't guarantee a timeline on fixes.
