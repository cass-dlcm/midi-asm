# midi-asm

Originally created for my Computer Architecture and Assembly Programming class at Florida Tech.
I've made some improvements on it since then.

It generates random music compositions.
Each composition consists of:
* a track of piano chords
* a series of guitar riffs using those same chords
* a series of drum patterns

To use it, simply open the exe.
Building it requires Visual Studio.
It's currently tested only on the latest version of Windows 10, built from Visual Studio 2019.
